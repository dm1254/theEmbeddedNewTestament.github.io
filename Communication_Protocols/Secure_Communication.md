## ðŸ§  **Concept First**

### **Security vs Convenience**
**Concept**: Security measures often make systems less convenient but more trustworthy.
**Why it matters**: In embedded systems, you must balance security with usability and performance constraints.
**Minimal example**: Compare unencrypted vs. encrypted communication for a simple sensor.
**Try it**: Implement both approaches and measure the performance and security differences.
**Takeaways**: Security is a trade-off that must be carefully considered for each application.

### **Threat Model First**
**Concept**: You must understand what you're protecting against before designing security measures.
**Why it matters**: Without a clear threat model, you may implement unnecessary security or miss critical vulnerabilities.
**Minimal example**: Design security for a home sensor vs. an industrial control system.
**Try it**: Create threat models for different types of embedded systems.
**Takeaways**: Security design should be driven by threat analysis, not by available security features.

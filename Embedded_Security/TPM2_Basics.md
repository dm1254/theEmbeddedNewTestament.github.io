# TPM 2.0 Basics

## Introduction to Trusted Platform Module

The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) represents a fundamental shift in how we think about security in embedded systems. Rather than treating security as an afterthought or a software layer that can be compromised, TPM provides a hardware root of trust that becomes the foundation upon which all other security measures are built. This hardware-based approach ensures that even if the main processor or memory is compromised, the TPM remains a secure enclave that can verify the integrity of the system.

At its core, TPM 2.0 is not just a security chip—it's a complete security subsystem that operates independently of the main processor. This independence is crucial because it means that even sophisticated attacks that compromise the main system cannot easily access the TPM's secure storage or cryptographic operations. The TPM becomes a trusted witness that can attest to the system's state and provide cryptographic services that are resistant to software-based attacks.

## TPM 2.0 Architecture and Design Philosophy

The architecture of TPM 2.0 reflects a deep understanding of the security challenges faced by modern embedded systems. Unlike its predecessor, TPM 1.2, which was designed primarily for PC platforms, TPM 2.0 was architected from the ground up to address the diverse needs of embedded systems, IoT devices, and mobile platforms. This architectural evolution represents a fundamental shift in thinking about security—from a monolithic approach to a modular, flexible system that can adapt to different security requirements.

The TPM 2.0 architecture is built around the concept of hierarchical trust. At the top of this hierarchy sits the Storage Root Key (SRK), which is embedded in the TPM during manufacturing and cannot be changed. This key serves as the cryptographic anchor for the entire system, and all other keys and credentials derive their trust from this root. Below the SRK, the TPM maintains separate hierarchies for different purposes: the Storage Hierarchy for general storage, the Endorsement Hierarchy for platform attestation, and the Platform Hierarchy for platform-specific operations.

This hierarchical design serves several important purposes. First, it provides clear separation of concerns, allowing different parts of the system to operate with different levels of trust. Second, it enables key isolation, ensuring that compromise of one hierarchy doesn't automatically compromise others. Finally, it supports flexible key management, allowing keys to be created, used, and destroyed without affecting the overall security posture of the system.

## Cryptographic Capabilities and Key Management

The cryptographic capabilities of TPM 2.0 represent a significant advancement over previous security solutions. The TPM supports a wide range of cryptographic algorithms, including both symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, and digital signatures. This comprehensive cryptographic support means that the TPM can handle virtually any security requirement that might arise in an embedded system.

One of the most important aspects of TPM 2.0's cryptographic capabilities is its support for multiple key types and algorithms. Unlike earlier versions that were limited to specific algorithms, TPM 2.0 can work with RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and various symmetric algorithms. This flexibility is crucial for embedded systems that may need to comply with different security standards or work with legacy systems that use older cryptographic methods.

The key management system in TPM 2.0 is designed around the principle of secure key generation and storage. When a key is created, it can be generated entirely within the TPM, ensuring that the private key material never leaves the secure boundary of the TPM chip. This is a critical security feature because it means that even if an attacker gains access to the system memory or storage, they cannot extract the private keys that are stored within the TPM.

The TPM also supports a sophisticated key hierarchy that allows for flexible key management. Keys can be created as children of other keys, with the parent key providing protection for its children. This hierarchical approach enables complex key management scenarios, such as creating temporary keys for specific operations or implementing key escrow systems for backup and recovery purposes.

## Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) and Measurement

Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) represent one of the most powerful features of TPM 2.0, providing a mechanism for measuring and attesting to the integrity of the system. PCRs are special registers within the TPM that can only be written to through specific operations, and their values are cryptographically protected against tampering. This makes them ideal for storing measurements of system components and configuration.

The measurement process works by calculating cryptographic hashes of system components and then extending these hashes into the PCRs. When a component is measured, its hash is combined with the current PCR value using a specific algorithm, creating a new PCR value that represents the cumulative measurement of all components measured so far. This cumulative approach means that the final PCR values provide a complete picture of the system's state, and any change to any measured component will result in different PCR values.

The use of PCRs for system integrity measurement has profound implications for security. By measuring critical system components such as the bootloader, operating system kernel, and key applications, the TPM can create a verifiable record of what software is running on the system. This record can then be used for attestation, allowing remote parties to verify that the system is running trusted software and hasn't been compromised.

The TPM 2.0 specification defines 24 PCRs, each of which can be used for different purposes. PCRs 0-7 are typically reserved for the core system components, while PCRs 8-15 can be used for application-specific measurements. PCRs 16-23 are available for user-defined purposes, providing flexibility for different use cases and security requirements.

## Attestation and Remote Verification

Attestation is the process by which a system proves its identity and integrity to a remote party. TPM 2.0 provides comprehensive support for attestation through a combination of cryptographic operations and measurement data. This attestation capability is crucial for establishing trust in distributed systems, cloud computing environments, and IoT networks where devices need to prove their trustworthiness to other systems.

The attestation process begins with the TPM creating a signed statement about the current state of the system. This statement includes the current values of the PCRs, which represent the measurements of the system components. The TPM signs this statement using an attestation key, which is a special key that can only be used for attestation purposes. This signature provides cryptographic proof that the statement was created by a genuine TPM and hasn't been tampered with.

Remote verification of attestation data involves several steps. First, the verifier must establish trust in the TPM that created the attestation. This is typically done through a certificate chain that leads back to a trusted root certificate authority. Once trust in the TPM is established, the verifier can examine the attestation data to determine whether the system is running trusted software and hasn't been compromised.

The attestation process can be enhanced with additional security measures, such as requiring specific PCR values or checking that the system is running approved software versions. This flexibility allows for sophisticated security policies that can adapt to different threat environments and compliance requirements.

## Secure Storage and Data Protection

Secure storage is another critical capability provided by TPM 2.0. The TPM can store sensitive data in a way that protects it from unauthorized access, even if the main system is compromised. This secure storage capability is essential for protecting encryption keys, user credentials, and other sensitive information that must be preserved across system reboots or power cycles.

The TPM's secure storage works by encrypting data using keys that are stored within the TPM itself. When data is stored, it's encrypted using a storage key, and the encrypted data is stored in external memory or storage. The storage key is protected by the TPM's internal key hierarchy, ensuring that even if the encrypted data is accessed, it cannot be decrypted without access to the TPM.

One of the most powerful features of TPM 2.0's secure storage is its support for sealed storage. Sealed storage allows data to be encrypted in such a way that it can only be decrypted when the system is in a specific state. This is achieved by including PCR values in the encryption process, so that the data can only be decrypted when the PCRs contain the expected values. This feature is particularly useful for protecting encryption keys that should only be available when the system is running trusted software.

The TPM also supports secure key backup and recovery through a process called key migration. This allows keys to be securely transferred between TPMs or backed up for disaster recovery purposes. The migration process is designed to maintain the security of the keys throughout the transfer, ensuring that they remain protected even during backup and recovery operations.

## Integration with Embedded Systems

Integrating TPM 2.0 into embedded systems requires careful consideration of both hardware and software requirements. From a hardware perspective, the TPM needs to be connected to the main processor through a secure communication channel, typically using SPI or I2C interfaces. The physical security of the TPM is also important, as physical access to the TPM chip could potentially compromise the entire security system.

From a software perspective, TPM 2.0 integration requires implementing the TPM 2.0 command interface and managing the various TPM resources such as keys, PCRs, and storage areas. The TPM 2.0 specification defines a comprehensive command set that covers all aspects of TPM operation, from basic cryptographic operations to complex key management and attestation procedures.

The integration process typically begins with TPM initialization, which involves establishing the initial key hierarchy and configuring the PCRs for the specific system requirements. This initialization process is critical because it establishes the foundation for all subsequent security operations. Once initialized, the TPM can be used for various security functions such as secure boot, secure storage, and remote attestation.

One of the challenges in TPM 2.0 integration is managing the complexity of the TPM command interface. The TPM 2.0 specification is quite comprehensive, and implementing all the required functionality can be a significant undertaking. However, many embedded systems don't need the full range of TPM capabilities, and a subset of the command set can be implemented to meet specific security requirements.

## Practical Implementation Considerations

When implementing TPM 2.0 in embedded systems, several practical considerations must be addressed. First, the TPM requires a reliable source of entropy for cryptographic operations. This entropy is used for generating random numbers and creating cryptographic keys. In embedded systems, this entropy can be provided by hardware random number generators or by collecting entropy from various system sources such as timing variations and sensor noise.

Another important consideration is power management. TPM 2.0 chips typically have specific power requirements and may need to maintain certain state information even during low-power modes. This is particularly important for embedded systems that may spend significant time in sleep or standby modes. The TPM must be able to wake up quickly when needed and maintain its security state across power transitions.

Memory management is also a critical consideration in TPM 2.0 implementation. The TPM has limited internal memory, and most data must be stored externally. This external storage must be managed carefully to ensure that sensitive data is properly protected and that the TPM can access the data it needs when performing operations.

Performance considerations are also important, especially in real-time embedded systems. TPM operations can take significant time, particularly for complex cryptographic operations. The system design must account for these timing requirements and ensure that TPM operations don't interfere with critical real-time functions.

## Security Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

Implementing TPM 2.0 securely requires adherence to several best practices and awareness of common pitfalls. One of the most important best practices is to use the TPM's built-in security features rather than trying to implement security in software. The TPM is specifically designed to provide secure cryptographic operations, and attempting to duplicate this functionality in software can introduce vulnerabilities.

Another important best practice is to properly manage the TPM's authorization mechanisms. TPM 2.0 supports multiple types of authorization, including password-based, HMAC-based, and policy-based authorization. The choice of authorization method should be based on the specific security requirements of the system, and the authorization credentials should be managed securely.

Common pitfalls in TPM 2.0 implementation include improper key management, insufficient entropy for cryptographic operations, and failure to properly validate attestation data. These pitfalls can significantly reduce the security benefits provided by the TPM and potentially introduce new vulnerabilities.

Key management is particularly important because the security of the entire system depends on the proper protection of cryptographic keys. Keys should be created with appropriate attributes, stored securely, and rotated regularly according to security policies. The TPM's key hierarchy should be used effectively to provide proper key isolation and protection.

## Future Directions and Advanced Features

TPM 2.0 continues to evolve with new features and capabilities being added to address emerging security challenges. One area of active development is quantum-resistant cryptography, which will become increasingly important as quantum computing technology advances. The TPM 2.0 specification is designed to be extensible, allowing new cryptographic algorithms to be added as they become standardized.

Another area of development is enhanced attestation capabilities, including support for more sophisticated measurement and reporting mechanisms. These enhancements will enable more detailed and accurate system integrity reporting, which is essential for advanced security applications such as zero-trust networks and secure multi-party computation.

The integration of TPM 2.0 with other security technologies is also an area of active research and development. For example, TPM 2.0 can be integrated with secure enclaves such as ARM TrustZone or Intel SGX to provide additional layers of security. This integration can create more sophisticated security architectures that combine the strengths of multiple security technologies.

As embedded systems become more complex and interconnected, the role of TPM 2.0 in providing hardware-based security will become increasingly important. The TPM's ability to provide a trusted foundation for security operations makes it an essential component of modern embedded systems, and its continued evolution will help address the security challenges of the future.

## Conclusion

TPM 2.0 represents a fundamental advancement in embedded system security, providing a hardware-based foundation for trust that cannot be easily compromised by software attacks. Its comprehensive cryptographic capabilities, sophisticated key management, and powerful attestation features make it an essential component for any embedded system that requires high levels of security.

The successful implementation of TPM 2.0 in embedded systems requires careful attention to both hardware and software integration, as well as adherence to security best practices. However, the security benefits provided by TPM 2.0 far outweigh the implementation challenges, making it a worthwhile investment for systems that require robust security.

As embedded systems continue to evolve and face new security challenges, TPM 2.0 will play an increasingly important role in providing the security foundation that these systems need. Its flexible architecture and extensible design ensure that it can adapt to new security requirements and continue to provide effective protection against evolving threats.

## 🎯 **Overview**

Interrupts and exceptions are fundamental mechanisms that allow embedded systems to respond to external events and handle errors efficiently. Understanding interrupt handling is crucial for real-time system design and reliable embedded applications.

---

## 🚀 **Quick Reference: Key Facts**

- **Interrupt Vector Table**: Maps interrupt sources to handler functions
- **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**: Function executed when interrupt occurs  
- **Interrupt Latency**: Time from interrupt occurrence to handler execution
- **Exception Handling**: Managing system errors and faults
- **Priority Levels**: ARM Cortex-M supports up to 256 priority levels
- **Nesting**: Higher priority interrupts can preempt lower priority ones
- **Context Saving**: CPU automatically saves/restores registers during ISR execution

## 🔍 **Visual Understanding**

### **Interrupt Processing Flow**
```
Normal Execution → Interrupt Occurs → Context Save → ISR Execution → Context Restore → Resume Execution
     ↓                    ↓              ↓           ↓              ↓              ↓
   Main Loop        Hardware Event   Save Regs   Process IRQ   Restore Regs   Continue
```

### **Interrupt Priority and Nesting**
```
Priority 0 (Highest) ──┐
                        ├── Can interrupt any lower priority
Priority 1 ────────────┤
                        ├── Cannot interrupt Priority 0
Priority 2 ────────────┤
                        └── Cannot interrupt Priority 0 or 1
Priority 3 (Lowest) ───┘
```

## 🧠 **Conceptual Foundation**

### **The Interrupt-Driven Paradigm**
Interrupts represent a fundamental shift from polling-based systems to event-driven architectures. Instead of continuously checking for events, the system waits for hardware to signal when something needs attention. This paradigm enables:
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: CPU sleeps until needed
- **Real-Time Responsiveness**: Immediate response to critical events
- **Power Optimization**: Reduced active time in battery-powered systems

### **Why Interrupts and Exceptions Matter**
Interrupts are the backbone of real-time embedded systems. They enable:
- **Responsive User Interfaces**: Immediate response to button presses
- **Efficient Communication**: Process data only when available
- **System Reliability**: Handle errors and faults gracefully
- **Resource Management**: Coordinate multiple hardware peripherals

### **The Interrupt Design Challenge**
Designing interrupt systems involves balancing several competing concerns:
- **Latency vs. Complexity**: Faster response requires simpler ISRs
- **Priority vs. Fairness**: Critical interrupts need immediate attention
- **Safety vs. Performance**: Robust error handling vs. minimal overhead

---

## 🎯 **Core Concepts**

### **Concept: Interrupt Vector Table and Handler Registration**

**Why it matters**: The vector table is the central nervous system of interrupt handling. It maps each interrupt source to its corresponding handler function, enabling the CPU to jump to the right code when interrupts occur.

**Minimal example**
```c
// Basic interrupt handler registration
typedef void (*interrupt_handler_t)(void);

// Simple vector table structure
typedef struct {
    interrupt_handler_t reset_handler;
    interrupt_handler_t nmi_handler;
    interrupt_handler_t hardfault_handler;
    interrupt_handler_t irq_handlers[16];  // External interrupts
} vector_table_t;

// Register a handler for a specific interrupt
void register_interrupt_handler(uint8_t irq_number, interrupt_handler_t handler) {
    if (irq_number < 16) {
        vector_table.irq_handlers[irq_number] = handler;
    }
}
```

**Try it**: Create a simple vector table with handlers for timer and UART interrupts.

**Takeaways**
- Vector table must be properly aligned in memory
- Handler functions must have correct calling convention
- Unused interrupts should point to a default handler

### **Concept: Interrupt Service Routine Design Principles**

**Why it matters**: ISR design directly impacts system responsiveness and reliability. Poorly designed ISRs can cause missed interrupts, priority inversion, and system instability.

**Minimal example**
```c
// Good ISR design - minimal and fast
volatile bool data_ready = false;
volatile uint8_t received_data = 0;

void uart_rx_isr(void) {
    // Clear interrupt flag immediately
    UART1->SR &= ~UART_SR_RXNE;
    
    // Minimal processing - just capture data
    received_data = UART1->DR;
    data_ready = true;
    
    // Let main loop handle the data processing
}
```

**Try it**: Design an ISR for a GPIO button press that sets a flag for main loop processing.

**Takeaways**
- Keep ISRs short and deterministic
- Avoid function calls and complex operations
- Use flags to communicate with main loop
- Clear interrupt flags early

### **Concept: Interrupt Priority and Nesting Management**

**Why it matters**: Proper priority management ensures critical interrupts get immediate attention while preventing priority inversion and ensuring system responsiveness.

**Minimal example**
```c
// Configure interrupt priorities
void configure_interrupt_priorities(void) {
    // Set system timer to highest priority (lowest number)
    NVIC_SetPriority(SysTick_IRQn, 0);
    
    // Set UART to medium priority
    NVIC_SetPriority(UART1_IRQn, 2);
    
    // Set GPIO to lower priority
    NVIC_SetPriority(EXTI0_IRQn, 4);
    
    // Enable all interrupts
    NVIC_EnableIRQ(SysTick_IRQn);
    NVIC_EnableIRQ(UART1_IRQn);
    NVIC_EnableIRQ(EXTI0_IRQn);
}
```

**Try it**: Configure three interrupts with different priorities and observe nesting behavior.

**Takeaways**
- Lower priority numbers = higher priority
- Higher priority interrupts can preempt lower ones
- Consider system-wide priority strategy
- Test priority interactions thoroughly

### **Concept: Exception Handling and Fault Recovery**

**Why it matters**: Exceptions represent system errors that must be handled gracefully. Proper exception handling prevents system crashes and enables recovery from transient faults.

**Minimal example**
```c
// Basic hard fault handler
void hardfault_handler(void) {
    // Capture fault information
    uint32_t fault_address = SCB->MMFAR;  // Memory fault address
    uint32_t fault_status = SCB->CFSR;    // Combined fault status
    
    // Log fault information (if possible)
    log_fault_info(fault_address, fault_status);
    
    // Attempt recovery or reset
    if (can_recover_from_fault(fault_status)) {
        // Try to continue
        return;
    } else {
        // Reset system if recovery not possible
        system_reset();
    }
}
```

**Try it**: Implement a fault handler that logs error information and attempts recovery.

**Takeaways**
- Always have exception handlers for critical faults
- Log fault information for debugging
- Implement recovery mechanisms when possible
- Reset system if recovery fails

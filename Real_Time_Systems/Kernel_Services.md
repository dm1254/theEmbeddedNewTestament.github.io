## üéØ Overview

Kernel services coordinate concurrent tasks and ISRs safely. The choice of primitive affects latency, throughput, memory usage, and correctness. Prefer minimal mechanisms that clearly express intent.

## üß† Mental Model

```
Interrupts ‚îÄ‚îÄ> [Signal] ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Tasks
                 ‚îÇ            ‚îÇ
                 ‚îÇ            ‚îî‚îÄ Work (process data / control)
                 ‚îî‚îÄ Primitives: Notification, Queue, Semaphore, EventGroup

Resources ‚îÄ‚îÄ> [Protect] ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Mutex (tasks only) / Binary semaphore (rare)
```

- Use the lightest signaling that conveys the needed information and constraints.
- Separate signaling (events) from protection (mutual exclusion).

---

## üß≠ Choosing the Right Primitive

- Direct-to-Task Notification: fastest 1-to-1 signaling; can carry a small value or count.
- Queue: message passing (copies data); natural back-pressure via finite length.
- Stream/Message Buffer: efficient byte/message streams to a single receiver.
- Event Group: multi-bit events; good for waiting on combinations (ANY/ALL).
- Binary Semaphore: generic event signal; avoid for mutual exclusion.
- Mutex: mutual exclusion with priority inheritance (tasks only; not for ISRs).

Guideline: If you only need to wake a specific task, use a notification. If you need to transfer data, use a queue or stream/message buffer.

## üîç Primitives in Depth

### Direct-to-Task Notifications
- Lowest overhead; ideal for ISR‚Üítask wakeups.
- Modes: set bit, overwrite/set value, increment count.
- One notification slot per task; use careful design when multiple sources signal the same task.

### Queues
- Fixed-size buffer of messages (by copy). Size determines back-pressure.
- Blocking send/receive with timeouts for deterministic behavior.
- Multiple producers; one or many consumers (ownership by design).

### Stream/Message Buffers
- Single receiver; zero-copy into circular buffer managed by kernel.
- Stream Buffer: bytes; Message Buffer: discrete messages.
- Great for ISR‚Üítask data at lower overhead than queues for larger transfers.

### Event Groups
- Bitmask of events; tasks can wait for ANY or ALL bits with timeout.
- Avoid for data transfer; use to coordinate multi-condition readiness.

### Semaphores
- Binary: event signal; historically misused for mutex. Prefer notifications for wakeups and mutex for protection.
- Counting: represent N identical resources or multi-count events.

### Mutexes
- Provide mutual exclusion with priority inheritance to mitigate inversion.
- Tasks only (not safe from ISRs). Hold times must be short and bounded.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timing, Back-Pressure, and Buffering

- Always use finite buffers (queues) to create back-pressure and apply timeouts to avoid deadlock.
- For periodic producers and bursty consumers, consider stream/message buffers with thresholds.
- For latency-critical events, favor notifications; for throughput, tune queue length and message size.

---

## üì¨ Patterns for ISR‚ÜíTask Deferral

- Notification: wake a dedicated worker task; optionally pass a small value.
- Queue: push small structs (timestamps, IDs). Keep ISR copy small and constant-time.
- Stream/Message Buffer: push larger payloads; task drains and processes.
- Event Group: set event bits; a coordinator task reacts to combined conditions.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- Using mutexes in ISRs (not allowed). Use semaphores/notifications FromISR instead.
- Priority inversion when sharing resources without mutexes (use priority inheritance).
- Unbounded blocking on queues/semaphores leading to deadlocks.
- Overusing event groups for data or as a general message bus.
- Excessive copying in queues for large payloads (use stream/message buffers or pointers with ownership rules).

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Prefer notifications for wakeups; queues/buffers for data; mutexes only for mutual exclusion.
- Apply timeouts on all blocking calls; define policies for what to do on timeout.
- Keep critical sections and lock hold times short.
- Document ownership and lifetime of data passed between tasks.
- Monitor queue depths and missed notifications to validate sizing.

## üé§ Interview Questions

1. When would you choose a direct-to-task notification over a queue?
2. How does priority inheritance work and why is it important for mutexes?
3. Compare queues vs stream/message buffers for ISR‚Üítask data transfer.
4. How do you design timeouts and back-pressure to avoid deadlocks?
5. What are safe synchronization options inside ISRs and why?
